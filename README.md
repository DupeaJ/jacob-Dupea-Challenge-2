# jacob-Dupea-Challenge-2
## Description
For my Challenge 2, I had to make code from scratch and base it off a portfolio example. Making a website from scratch is challenging especially since ive never done it before. The webpage helps create a portfolio site so i can add my work i complete in the future since i dont have many projects yet. It should be interactive and visually apealing with affects and working links.
CSS also has notes for easy understanding of the styling. 
I learned what it means to make a website from scratch and how to style with flexbox.
I learned some new features as well, I greatly increased my understanding of flexbox and well as introduced myself to psudo code and hover aspects.
